# DMG Background Image Placeholder

This file is a placeholder for the macOS DMG installer background image.

The actual image should be:
- Dimensions: 800x450 pixels
- Format: PNG with transparency support
- Design: Modern, clean design that complements the PDF4QT branding
- Content: PDF4QT logo, application icon, and visual instructions for installation

To create the actual background:
1. Design a 800x450px image with PDF4QT branding
2. Include visual cues showing drag-and-drop to Applications folder
3. Use colors that match the glassmorphism UI theme
4. Save as PNG: `dmg-background.png`
5. Replace this placeholder file

For automated builds, the DMG creation script will work without this image,
but a custom background provides a more professional installer experience.
